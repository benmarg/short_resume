<p>Hi! I’m Ben,  a Seattle-based Full Stack developer working day-to-day with  React, Next.js, Typescript, and more!</p>
<p>I’m passionate about creating beautiful solutions that solve real problems for users. That means I don’t just start and stop my day in VSCode. I go out, talk to users, think outside-the-box, and come up with a game plan that solves the problem, with strong opinions loosely held, even if that doesn’t involve a single line of code.</p>
<p>Technologies I enjoy working with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Next.js</li>
<li>Typescript</li>
<li>TailwindCSS</li>
<li>Prisma/Drizzle</li>
<li>tRPC</li>
<li>React Query</li>
<li>Supermaven</li></lii>
<li>SaaS: Vercel, Upstash, Supabase, Clerk, Sentry</li>
</ul>

<p>To wrap things up, a quote I think about often when working on solutions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Be guided by beauty. I really mean that. Pretty much everything I’ve done has had an aesthetic component, at least to me. Now you might think ‘well, building a company that’s trading bonds, what’s so aesthetic about that?’ But, what’s aesthetic about it is doing it right. Getting the right kind of people, and approaching the problem, and doing it right […] it’s a beautiful thing to do something right.” - Jim Simons</p>
